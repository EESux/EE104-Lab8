The OpenAI Cookbook provides a collection of example code, techniques, and best practices for working with OpenAI's API, models, and tools. The Q&A, Web-crawl Q&A, and File Q&A examples found in this repository demonstrate how to leverage OpenAI's powerful natural language understanding capabilities for answering questions based on given text, scraped from websites, or extracted from files.

Q&A
The Q&A example demonstrates how to use OpenAI's models to answer questions based on a given context. This can be particularly useful for applications like customer support, knowledge extraction, fact-checking, and more.

You can use this example as a starting point to integrate OpenAI's models into your application to answer questions based on specific text provided by you or your users.

Web-crawl Q&A
The Web-crawl Q&A example goes a step further and shows you how to automatically crawl a website, process the text, and generate embeddings for each chunk of text. The generated embeddings can then be used to answer questions based on the information extracted from the crawled website.

This example is particularly useful when you want to provide answers to questions based on information available on a specific website or when you want to build a knowledge base from a set of web pages. Some use cases include providing answers to questions about a company's products, services, or policies based on their website's content, or creating a specialized knowledge base for a particular domain.

File Q&A
The File Q&A example shows you how to extract information from files, such as PDFs or text documents, and use OpenAI's models to answer questions based on the extracted content. This can be useful for applications like document analysis, information extraction from reports, or answering questions from research papers.

You can use this example as a starting point to integrate OpenAI's models into your application to answer questions based on the content of files provided by you or your users.

To get started with these examples, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook.git
Navigate to the appropriate directory for the example you want to try, either examples/question_answering for Q&A, examples/web-crawl-q-and-a for Web-crawl Q&A, or examples/file-q-and-a for File Q&A.
Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Make sure you have an OpenAI API key and set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable. You can set it with the following command: export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key'.
Run the example code using python main.py for Q&A, python web-qa.py for Web-crawl Q&A, or python file-qa.py for File Q&A.
Modify the code as needed for your specific use case, and integrate it into your application.
Please note that you may need to adjust the code and parameters depending on your specific requirements and the models you're using. Remember to follow OpenAI's usage guidelines and rate limits when working with the API.
